NativeIntercept is a small library that uses bytecode generation to instrument classes with native
methods to allow those methods to be handled by java code rather than native code.

Notes:
- This is currently pre-alpha. It's had limited testing and mostly works, but there's probably a lot
  of bugs.
- This requires Java 1.6 or higher. While the Java agent functionality was available in Java 1.5,
  this library uses the Instrumentation#setNativePrefix method which was added in 1.6.
- This library uses the excellent ASM bytecode manipulation library. That project can be found at:
  http://asm.ow2.org
  This also uses the JarJar library to package the version of asm that's expected in the
  distribution jar without conflicting with another version of the library that may be on the
  classpath. That project can be found at: http://code.google.com/p/jarjar/
